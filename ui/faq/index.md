## Accordion

An accordion is a UI/UX component used to organize and display content in a space-efficient, collapsible format. It consists of vertically stacked sections, each with a clickable header that expands or collapses its associated content. This design helps reduce visual clutter, allowing users to focus on one section at a time while keeping other content hidden until needed. Commonly used in FAQs, filters, or mobile menus, accordions enhance usability by streamlining content access and improving navigation on both desktop and mobile interfaces.

## Avatar circle

An avatar circle is a UI/UX component that displays a user’s profile image or initials within a circle, commonly used to represent a user identity in apps, websites, and social platforms. This visual element provides a quick, recognizable way for users to identify themselves or others, often appearing in headers, comments, chat interfaces, and account menus. The circular shape is aesthetically pleasing and universally recognized as a placeholder for personal identity, contributing to a more humanized and personalized user experience. When no image is available, initials or default icons are often shown inside the circle.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a UI/UX navigation component that displays a trail of links showing the user's current location within a website or app's hierarchy, typically appearing near the top of a page. Each link represents a parent page, allowing users to easily backtrack or understand the structure of the site. Breadcrumbs enhance usability by improving orientation, reducing the number of actions needed to navigate, and helping users avoid getting lost—especially in websites with deep or complex navigation paths, like e-commerce or content-heavy platforms.

## Header

A header is a fundamental UI/UX component typically positioned at the top of a web page or app screen, serving as a consistent area for branding, navigation, and key actions. It often contains elements like a logo, navigation links, search bars, user profiles, or call-to-action buttons. The header plays a crucial role in guiding users, providing context, and enabling quick access to essential features across the site or application. A well-designed header enhances usability, reinforces brand identity, and supports intuitive navigation throughout the user experience.

## Footer

A footer is a fundamental UI/UX component located at the bottom of a web page or app screen, typically used to provide secondary navigation, legal information, contact details, and links to important but less prominent content like privacy policies, terms of service, or social media profiles. It serves as a closing section that helps users find additional resources or revisit key areas without scrolling back to the top. A well-structured footer improves site usability, reinforces trust, and ensures accessibility to critical information, especially on long or content-rich pages.

## Hamburger menu

A hamburger menu is a UI/UX component represented by a small icon with three horizontal lines, resembling a hamburger, typically located in the top corner of a user interface. When clicked or tapped, it reveals a hidden navigation menu or list of options, helping to keep the main interface clean and uncluttered—especially on mobile devices or smaller screens. While it saves space and simplifies the layout, its discoverability and usability have been debated, as some users may not immediately recognize its function without prior experience.

## Holy Grail layout

The **Holy Grail layout** is a classic and widely used web design pattern that features a three-column structure with a fixed header at the top and a footer at the bottom. The layout includes a main content area in the center, flanked by a left sidebar (often for navigation) and a right sidebar (commonly used for related content or ads). Its name reflects its long-standing value and flexibility in UI/UX design, offering a balanced way to organize content for readability and functionality. The Holy Grail layout is particularly effective for desktop interfaces, providing clear structure and easy access to key elements while maintaining a cohesive, user-friendly experience.

## Theme chooser 

A theme chooser is a UI/UX component that allows users to switch between different visual styles or color schemes of an interface, most commonly between a light theme and a dark theme. This component enhances personalization and accessibility by letting users select a theme that suits their preferences, environment, or visual comfort—such as using dark mode in low-light settings to reduce eye strain. Typically found in settings menus or as a toggle icon (like a sun/moon), the theme chooser contributes to a more user-centric experience by adapting the interface to different contexts while maintaining consistent functionality.

## Slide-out drawer

A slide-out drawer is a UI/UX component that slides in from the side of the screen—usually from the left or right—to reveal additional content or navigation options without leaving the current page. Often triggered by a button or swipe gesture, it’s commonly used for menus, filters, settings, or secondary content in mobile and web applications. This component allows for efficient use of screen space by keeping less frequently used options hidden until needed, enhancing focus and minimizing clutter in the main interface while maintaining easy access to extended functionality.
